				<p><em>The Curiosity of School</em> is the story of institutionalized education, from the early-mid 19th century all the way up to the present. It covers topics such as standardized testing, the role of corporations in higher education, and the growing student debt crisis. Through it all, Zander Sherman recounts the ways in which school has been used to manufacture outcomes—to turn students into soldiers, citizens, and human capital. In this rational, youthful, and surprisingly funny debut from Penguin Canada, Sherman asks what it means to have an education.</p>

						<h3>What made you want to write this book?</h3>
						<p>I wanted to show the history of an institution we don’t think of as having a history. School is a strange thing. We spend a lot of time in it, and we learn different things while we’re there, but we’re never taught about the institution itself. It turns out that the history of school is powerful, and at times quite dark. Exploring this subject involved looking at things like eugenics, cultural genocide, and various kinds of abuse. Heavy stuff, to be sure.</p>

						<h3>And so part of what you wanted to do was bring that history to light?</h3>
						<p>There are many conversations about topical issues affecting parents, teachers, administrators, and students. I wanted to deepen the debate by pointing to the origins. In my view, the system doesn’t value education for its own sake. It values education as a means to an end. It sounds like a subtle difference, and not something that immediately smacks of controversy, but this is in fact a major distinction.</p>

						<h3>How so?</h3>
						<p>In the current model, educative policies are dovetailed with economic ones. I’m no scholar of education, but to me this misses a fundamental point. If the purpose of the education system isn’t to educate, where and how will people learn? School should be about inspiring curiosity, piquing the interest of young people, and helping awaken a sense of passion and wonder. From that place of self-empowerment, students will be ready to greet the world of work, among much else.</p>

						<h3>You were homeschooled. How do you think that affected your view of education?</h3>
						<p>I was both home- and public schooled. Being in and out of the system gave me a unique perspective. I think it’s fair to say that a huge number of people are bored by school; for me it was the opposite. I found school fascinating—the workings of it, how it all fit together.</p>

						<h3>Some people view your book as an attack on institutionalized education. How do you respond?</h3>
						<p>The Curiosity of School is meant to be used as part of a conversation about education in broad terms: what it means to have one, and what it looks like when we don’t. The intention wasn’t to attack, but to begin a discussion. I mention this in the introduction. It’s also printed on the back of the book’s jacket.</p>

						<h3>Let’s talk about some of the issues. Are standardized tests good or bad?</h3>
						<p>My view of standardized tests is that they’re part of an economic mandate. That’s what the history points to, anyway. If students are all treated in the same way, it’s easier for them to be specialized prior to entering the world of work. If everyone receives a separate education, it’s less efficient for the system to produce skilled labor. So my comment here is simply to acknowledge the fact that this is an economic move, not an educative one.</p>

						<h3>Finland is said to have the greatest education system in the world. What lessons can we learn from Finns?</h3>
						<p>The Finnish system is for inspiration, not imitation. The whole reason why it’s so successful, in my opinion, is that it values education for its own sake. Students aren’t treated as human resources but as people who deserve to be informed, inspired, and empowered. The Finnish system was built with these things in mind, whereas I don’t think you could say the same thing about our own.</p>

						<h3>How important are teachers?</h3>
						<p>I personally think teaching should be a coveted profession. It should be a difficult job to get and it should pay really well. Teachers should be valued for having unique personalities, and given more free reign in the classroom to decide how best to help inspire their students.</p>

						<h3>You’ve written about the importance of Greek and Latin. How are these languages connected to an education as you see it?</h3>
						<p>Knowledge of the classical languages was once part of a pedagogy known as “formal discipline.” The idea was that the human brain was basically a muscle. With hard work and exercise, the muscle could be toughened, tightened, sculpted. That’s what learning Cicero and Sallust was all about. Today, we don’t look at the brain as a muscle but as a machine. There’s a certain narrowness to that view, I think. The point of an education shouldn’t be to program the brain with a special kind of worldview or skill set.</p>

						<h3>How do you feel about online learning?</h3>
						<p>I can see why people do it, but I still think there’s value to the idea of actually attending an institution. In my own experience, almost nothing compares to having a really great, deep, meaningful conversation with a few like-minded people. That can happen in- or outside of a school environment, but it would be nice if the system valued this as being part of the process of acquiring credentials. Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to be the case.</p>

						<h3>Are you in favor of homeschooling, deschooling, or unschooling?</h3>
						<p>I’m no more or less in favor of these approaches than any of the others. They all come with their pros and cons. One issue with the nontraditional methods is that they seem to neglect the fact that society is run by people with credentials. For better or worse, we’ve made the undergraduate degree a prerequisite for white-collar work. Oftentimes, homeschoolers, deschoolers, and unschoolers face a challenge when it comes to competing with someone from a Harvard background.</p>

						<h3>What about private or charter schools, Waldorf and Montessori?</h3>
						<p>From a pedagogical point of view, these are all interesting and unique approaches. From a scientific point of view, data supporting their effectiveness is often mixed. No system has been shown to be quantifiably better than another. It seems more about what kind of person you want your child to become. Someone with a Montessori background will see a different world than someone with a Waldorf one.</p>

						<h3>Which brings us back to public schooling. What do we need to do differently going forward?</h3>
						<p>Well again, I’m no policymaker or expert, but I think we need a system that values education for its own sake. A system that infuses or entangles learning with making money, or being a certain kind of person socially, seems designed to misfire. The bottom line is that it’s disempowering to be told what to do. Every student knows this well. By the same token, anyone who’s ever been excited or enthused about something knows the tremendous rush of excitement, liveliness, and passion it creates. Prioritize that feeling, and the rest will take care of itself.</p>
